# 🧠 NandGame Solutions

Welcome to my personal solutions for the [NandGame](https://nandgame.com) – a digital logic simulator where all logic gates are built from scratch using only NAND gates.

This repository contains my implementations of logic gates and other digital components, as part of the step-by-step progression in the game.

## 🧩 What is NandGame?

[NandGame](https://nandgame.com) is an educational logic game that guides players through building digital circuits, starting with a single building block: the NAND gate. Through incremental challenges, players construct fundamental logic gates and ultimately a functional CPU.
